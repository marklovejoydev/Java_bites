
All years divisible by 400 ARE leap years (e.g. 2000 was a leap year)

All years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years (e.g. 1700, 1800 and 1900 were not leap years)

All years divisible by 4 and not by 100 ARE leap years (e.g. 2004, 2008 and 2012 were leap years)

All years not divisible by 4 are NOT leap years (e.g. 2009, 2010 and 2011 were not leap years)

Challenge 2
If you want to tackle another challenge,
try these extensions to your LeapYear class from the previous page's process feedback challenge:

Add a method which takes a start year and an end year, 
and returns an array of all the leap years between.


Add a method which, when given a year, 
will return the closest leap year (this could be before or after the given year).
